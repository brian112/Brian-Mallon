                 <p class="text"> I am Brian Mallon, and well I guess I am a web dev, my knowledge in web development and design is purely self taught with help of Google.
                     Ever since I was 13 years old I have been studdying computers, which is when i created my first powerpoint on computer viruses as a school project, from that point on i was hooked. <br>
                     I was intrigued, before that point computers were just machines used for browsing google for funny photos and word document for school work.
                     Now they were machines with operating systems, ports, services, programing languages and I had to learn more.
                    <br>I am 19 now and have a been following my dream every day aiming to work for a computer networking/security company.</p>
